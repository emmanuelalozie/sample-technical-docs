# Technical Documentation Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Technical Documentation Repository. This repository serves as a centralized hub for various technical writeups, including specifications, project overviews, and detailed documentation for different tools and systems. Our goal is to provide clear, comprehensive, and easily accessible documentation to support developers, engineers, and stakeholders.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into several sections, each tailored to specific types of documentation or projects:

- **BDD Specifications**: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) specifications for software features and systems. These documents use scenarios to describe software behavior in a way that is understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Project Overviews**: Detailed descriptions and overviews of projects, including goals, technologies used, and implementation strategies.
- **Technical Guides**: Step-by-step guides and tutorials on using various technologies within our projects.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of APIs including endpoints, request/response formats, and sample calls.
