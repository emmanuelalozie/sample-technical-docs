# GPS Deals Locator App Feature

### 1. Test Plan Overview
- **Objective**: To ensure that the location-based store deal feature functions accurately and efficiently, providing users with store deals within a 1-mile radius of their current location.
- **Scope**: The test will cover the app's ability to retrieve and display store deals based on the user's geolocation, the accuracy of the location data, and the relevancy of the deals shown.
- **Tools**: GPS simulators, Automated testing tools (e.g., Selenium, Appium), Database access tools, and Network mocking tools.

### 2. Features to Be Tested
- Retrieval of the user’s current location.
- Display of store deals relevant to the user’s location within a 1-mile radius.
- Accuracy of the location data.
- Response time for fetching and displaying deals.
- User’s ability to refresh and update location manually.
- Error handling for location services being disabled or permissions denied.

### 3. Test Criteria
- **Pass Criteria**: The app should correctly identify the user's location, fetch store deals from the server accurately within the specified radius, and display them within acceptable response times.
- **Fail Criteria**: Incorrect location detection, displaying deals from outside the 1-mile radius, or failure to handle errors related to location services would constitute a failure.

### 4. Approach
- **Unit Testing**: Validate individual components for fetching location, querying the database for deals, and displaying them on the app.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure that components work together seamlessly, particularly integration with the location API and backend database.
- **System Testing**: Verify the complete and integrated software product for compliance with the specified requirements.
- **Performance Testing**: Test to ensure that the feature works quickly and reliably under various conditions, including different network speeds and user densities.
- **Security Testing**: Ensure that the user’s location data is handled securely, including compliance with data protection regulations.

### 5. Test Environment
- **Devices**: Multiple devices with various screen sizes and operating systems (iOS, Android).
- **Networks**: Different network types (Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G) and speeds.
- **Tools**: Use of location spoofing tools to simulate various geographic locations.

### 6. Test Data
- Simulated location coordinates for various test scenarios.
- Sample datasets of store deals.

### 7. Test Cases
#### Functional Test Cases
1. **TC1: Location Accuracy Test**
   - Objective: Verify that the app accurately retrieves the user’s current location.
   - Steps: Enable location services, open the app, and verify displayed coordinates.

2. **TC2: Deals Display Test**
   - Objective: Confirm that only deals within a 1-mile radius are shown.
   - Steps: Compare the deals displayed in the app with expected deals for given test coordinates.

#### Non-Functional Test Cases
1. **Performance Test Case**
   - Objective: Ensure the app retrieves and displays deals within 2 seconds.
   - Steps: Measure response times under various network conditions.

2. **Security Test Case**
   - Objective: Verify that location data is encrypted during transmission.
   - Steps: Intercept app network requests and inspect for encryption.

### 8. Reporting
- **Test Results**: Document test outcomes, including pass/fail status for each test case.
- **Issues**: Log detailed descriptions of any failures and anomalies.

### 9. Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Inaccuracy in geolocation services.
- **Mitigation**: Use high-quality and updated location services APIs; test extensively with various devices.

### 10. Review and Approval
- **Reviewers**: QA Lead, Development Team Lead, Product Manager.
- **Sign-off**: Required from all stakeholders before feature release.


## Scenarios
**As a** user of the store deal finder app  
**I want** the app to find deals within a 1-mile radius of my current location  
**So that** I can take advantage of deals close to me without having to travel far.

#### Scenario Outline: Location Accuracy Test
**Given** I have given the app permission to access my location services  
**When** I open the app  
**Then** the app should accurately retrieve and display my current location  
**And** show store deals within a 1-mile radius from my location.

#### Examples:
| Location        | Expected Deals    |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Location 1      | Deals in Radius 1 |
| Location 2      | Deals in Radius 2 |

#### Scenario Outline: Deals Display Test
**Given** the app has access to my current location  
**When** I am located at `<Location>`  
**Then** I should only see deals that are within a 1-mile radius of `<Location>`.

#### Examples:
| Location        | Expected Deals    |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Location 1      | Deals in Radius 1 |
| Location 2      | Deals in Radius 2 |

#### Scenario: User Manually Updates Location
**Given** the app is open and displaying deals  
**When** I manually update my location to a new area  
**Then** the app should refresh the deals to show only those within a 1-mile radius of the new area.

#### Scenario: Location Services Disabled
**Given** location services are disabled on my device  
**When** I open the app and try to find deals  
**Then** the app should prompt me to enable location services  
**And** should not display any deals until the service is enabled.

#### Scenario: Performance Test for Deal Retrieval
**Given** the app has access to my location  
**And** I have a stable internet connection  
**When** I request to see local deals  
**Then** the deals should load within 2 seconds.

#### Scenario: Security Test for Location Data
**Given** the app is transmitting my location data  
**When** the data is sent to the server  
**Then** the transmission should be encrypted  
**And** comply with data protection regulations.
